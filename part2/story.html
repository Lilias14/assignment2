    <h1>The Choice</h1>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Jonathan who loved to explore the world beyond his village. One day, while wandering, he found himself at a crossroads. Two paths stretched out before him: one wide, smooth, and inviting; the other narrow, rugged, and mysterious.</p>
    <p>At the crossroads, a wise old man sat with a peculiar smile. "To choose a path," the man said, "you must first choose a hand. In my right hand, I hold a clear, glowing stone that promises safety and ease. In my left hand, I hold a dark, shimmering stone that leads to challenge and discovery."</p>
    <p>Jonathan faced a decision. Which path would he take?</p>
